# Kalistorm

Kalistorm is my personal headless server running Kali Linux ARM on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+. It was built using Flask and Jinja, and is used for secure file sharing, custom API access, remote code development, penetration testing, media streaming, and gaming.

Kalistorm has been deactivated as of July 16th, 2020, and has been replaced by [Firestorm](https://github.com/computer-geek64/firestorm), my personal CentOS server.
